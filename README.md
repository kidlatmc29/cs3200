# cs3200

Hi! This is my cs3200 repo. This is used to store my working programming assignments from the class. Code examples or practice code maybe included here too.

*Please, if you're a fellow student looking for code to plagiarize, I beg you to reconsider. There a plenty of online resources that you can utilize. I recommended checking out the reference libraries for [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/ref/Reference.html), [C++](http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/), and [Python](https://docs.python.org/3/library/). If I find out that my code has been plagiarized, I will have to make this repo private.*
